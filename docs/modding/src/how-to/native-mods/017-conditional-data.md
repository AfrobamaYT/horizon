<!-- chapter: Conditional data -->

### Conditional data

A data file that carries NeoForge's `neoforge:conditions` loads only when every condition holds, and is
silently absent otherwise — as on NeoForge, where packs gate cross-mod recipes on the other mod being
there. The recipe loaders (crafting, the stations, brewing, the recipe book, and the packs' overlays
over them) all answer the gate; `mod_loaded` asks which mods' data is in the root: `minecraft`, always,
and the content mods that are on. `neoforge:true`, `not`, `and` and `or` combine; a condition the game
does not know leaves the file out, so a future shape fails closed. Tags, loot tables and advancements
do not answer the gate yet.
