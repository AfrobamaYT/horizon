<!-- chapter: Dimension shape -->

### Dimension shape

`LevelRef::dimension_shape` reads the loaded server level's build range, logical height,
skylight and ceiling from its dimension shape. It accepts `&dyn Host`, including when the
level is parked, and returns `None` for a stale or unavailable level or on a client. It does
not load a level or allocate.
