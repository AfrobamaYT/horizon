# Paper and Bukkit porting ledger

This is a map for porting plugin logic to Horizon native mods, **not** a Bukkit or
Paper compatibility layer. Java plugins do not run through these APIs. Event-by-event
mappings belong in the native hook catalog; this page covers other plugin services.
The Paper/Bukkit references below are public Javadoc, not implementation sources.

| Plugin API | Horizon native-mod route and limits |
| --- | --- |
| [Permissions](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/permissions/Permissible.html) | **Partial:** `NativeCommand::op` uses vanilla operator levels 0–4, not named permission nodes or Bukkit attachments. `native_player_command` can reject a player command; implement any finer policy in the mod. The command tree and dispatch are in `crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_server.rs`. |
| [Scheduler](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/scheduler/BukkitScheduler.html) | **Gap:** no general delayed, repeating or asynchronous plugin task service. `native_server_tick` provides start and end callbacks for non-paused server ticks: a mod can manage its own tick deadlines there, rather than assume Bukkit task ownership or cancellation. Block/fluid tick scheduling in `crates/horizon-world/src/level/` is for world ticks, not arbitrary tasks. |
| [PersistentDataContainer](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/persistence/PersistentDataContainer.html) | **Partial:** typed `AttachmentType<T>` with a codec persists mod-namespaced values on `Holder::Player` and `Holder::Entity`, among other holders. It is not a Bukkit data container or wire format; holders must be present, and player death copying is opt-in. See `crates/horizon-world/src/attachments.rs` and [server attachments](modding/src/concepts/trait-mods.md#server-attachments). |
| [ServicesManager](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/plugin/ServicesManager.html) | **Gap:** no equivalent provider registry, priority selection or economy service contract. Native mods must arrange their own integration; the host and attachment APIs are not a service registry. |
| [CommandExecutor](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/command/CommandExecutor.html) and Brigadier | **Partial:** register `NativeCommand` usages through `native_register_commands`, then handle player commands in `native_perform_command` and dedicated-console commands in `native_perform_console_command`. Horizon builds a command tree from its supported usage syntax; this is not a general Bukkit executor or arbitrary Brigadier registration. See `crates/horizon-client/src/game/modding/native_server.rs` and [server commands](https://arismoko.github.io/horizon/reference/hook-notes.html#server-commands-and-players). |

For callback signatures, side and current limitations, use [native mods](modding/src/how-to/native-mods.md)
and the hook declarations under `crates/horizon-mod-api/src/hooks/` at the fork revision being targeted.
